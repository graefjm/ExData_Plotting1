## Instructions for Exploratory Data Project 1

These are the directions on how to recreate the plots within this repo in r. There are 6 files in total that you will need.

* Loading Data.R
* Plot1.R
* Plot2.R
* Plot3.R
* Plot4.r
* Dataset which can be found here: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

Here are the steps you should take for this process:

1. Download and unzip the dataset from above into your working directory
2. Load the dataset using the 'Loading Data.R' script
3. Generate Plot 1 using the 'Plot1.R' script
4. Generate Plot 2 using the 'Plot2.R' script
5. Generate Plot 3 using the 'Plot3.R' script
6. Generate Plot 4 using the 'Plot4.R' script

Note: If you need to fix Plots 1-3 you might want to store the default par() options in a variable or use dev.new() to reset them to get only one plot per page.

After running the scripts, you should have the same .png plot files in your working directory as those that are in this repo.
